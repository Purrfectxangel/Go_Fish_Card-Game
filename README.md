# Go_Fish_Card-Game
The final project for Stevens course EE551 is to implement a card game via Python and Objected Oriented Programming (OOP). I implemented a Go Fish card game. Needless to say, I had great fun making this game.

### üêü General Description of "Go Fish"
"Go Fish" is a simple card game where players try to collect matching sets of four cards of the same rank, also known as "books". The goal is to win the most "books" of cards. The game can be played by 2 or more players, up to 6 players.
